\usage{read.peaks.profile(FILE)}
\arguments{
  \item{FILE}{Path to the crime scene profile with peak height data. }
}
\value{
  A list of three elements, \code{alleles}, \code{heights} and \code{sizes}.
  Each element is itself a list with r elements, where r is the number of replicates in the CSP. Each 
  of these elements is a matrix of n by x where n is the number of loci in the CSP,
  and x is the maximum number of peaks recorded at any locus for that replicate. 
}
\description{Reads the Crime Scene Profile from a CSV file of peak height data.}
\details{The input is a file in the CSV format (comma-separated values). 
It should have the following form:

\tabular{llccccccccc}{

Sample File \tab Marker \tab Allele 1 \tab \dots \tab Allele x \tab Height 1 \tab \dots \tab Height x \cr
sample 1 \tab locus 1 \tab 9.3 \tab \dots \tab 11 \tab 151 \tab \dots \tab 190 \cr  
\dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \cr  
sample 1 \tab locus n \tab 23 \tab \dots \tab NA \tab 301 \tab \dots \tab NA \cr  
sample r \tab locus 1 \tab 9.3 \tab \dots \tab 11 \tab 132 \tab \dots \tab 123 \cr  
\dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \tab \dots \cr  
sample r \tab locus n \tab 23 \tab \dots \tab NA \tab 256 \tab \dots \tab NA \cr  
}


Columns are separted by commas (not present in the table above). The first
line, containing the names of the columns needs to be present. 
x, r and n can be any number. Columns headed by "Allele 1 \dots x" should contain the allelic
designation of the peak. Columns headed by "Height 1 \dots x" should contain the peak height
in RFU.
